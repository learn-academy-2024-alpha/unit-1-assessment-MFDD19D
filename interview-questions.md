# UNIT 1 ASSESSMENT: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: if you don't know the answer try answering a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions: js

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

<!-- 1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github? -->

<!-- Your answer: 
like a database for your code to maintain and see cahnges as it grows, as the code is being used by multiple coders --> 

<!-- git is the main distributin warehouse of the code while github you can create repositories and can be beneficial with teams and project management -->


<!-- Researched answer: 

version control system through repositories and making updates within your code through time and how its being used.   -->
<!-- Git is the version control system itself, while GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and provides additional collaboration and project management features on top of Git.  -->

 <!-- 2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?   -->

<!-- Your answer: 
an array is a special type of object used for storing multiple values in a single variable. 

index is the placeholder within the array starting in th zero postion 
var array = [index0, index1, index2, index3]the array is waht holds the data that is going to be tested upon.  -->
 
<!-- Researched answer: -->
<!-- the index of an array identifies the position of an element within the array, while the value represents the actual data stored at that position. The combination of index and value allows programmers to access and manipulate the elements stored in an array efficiently. -->

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Objects: data types within javascrpt that has a collection of keyvalue pairs

2. Classes: are the b;lupringts for objects

3. React:system inwhich you see your code real time
