// UNIT 1 ASSESSMENT: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain WHY your initial answer was correct or incorrect.
// There is no need to change any of the code.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
// console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer:it will add indigo to the array of words in colors
// b) Verify and explain: it gave me the place holder of the 5th postiion within the array. 

// --------------------1) What will this log?

const cohort = "LEARN 2023"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer:this will be 10 because of the .lenght 
// b) Verify and explain:answer ten becasue it counted all the characters within the cohort array from index0 placement

// --------------------2) What will this log?

const greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[4])

// a) Your answer:i think its gonna give me the 4th placement within the array of l i think.
// b) Verify and explain: gave me the placement value of the following character which was "o"

// --------------------3) What will this log?

const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
const index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer:i think it will give me "ruby" due to it being in the 1value of the index within the array.
// b) Verify and explain: i go truby. so we called on languages and since we made index a const variable of 1, it gave us the value within the array instead of starting at the zero index

// --------------------4) What will this log?

const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer i think it will due an error but thats becasue i feel the quotes should be within the parenthesis after .toUpperCase

// b) Verify and explain:it gave me an error but i dont know why after playing with the code 
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// --------------------5) What will this log?

const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean", "undefined"]
console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: i think it will give us the number of cahracters by each individual string

// b) Verify and explain:it gave out number within the array. type of method i think it looked through the first array and found number. but am looking for the answer
